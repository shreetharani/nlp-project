More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to\\nprivacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only blackbox\\naccess to the trained model is granted. To build defenses, differential privacy\\nhas emerged as a mechanism to disguise the sensitive data in training datasets.\\nFollowing the strategy of Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE),\\nrecent methods leverage a large ensemble of teacher models.

However, the lack of transparency and\\naccountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus,\\nthere is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence\\nmechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature\\ncontributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by\\nblack-box models.

For supporting the interpretability without affecting the\\nperformance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a quasi-nonlinear\\nreasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides, we propose a\\nrecurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by unique fixed\\npoints while introducing a deterministic learning method to compute the tunable\\nparameters.

       "3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    With the increasing popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in several\\nsensitive applications like healthcare and medicine, concerns have been raised\\nover the privacy aspects of trained GNNs. More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to\\nprivacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only blackbox\\naccess to the trained model is granted. To build defenses, differential privacy\\nhas emerged as a mechanism to disguise the sensitive data in training datasets.\\nFollowing the strategy of Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE),\\nrecent methods leverage a large ensemble of teacher models. These teachers are\\ntrained on disjoint subsets of private data and are employed to transfer\\nknowledge to a student model, which is then released with privacy guarantees.\\nHowever, splitting graph data into many disjoint training sets may destroy the\\nstructural information and adversely affect accuracy. We propose a new\\ngraph-specific scheme of releasing a student GNN, which avoids splitting\\nprivate training data altogether. The student GNN is trained using public data,\\npartly labeled privately using the teacher GNN models trained exclusively for\\neach query node. We theoretically analyze our approach in the R\\`{e}nyi\\ndifferential privacy framework and provide privacy guarantees. Besides, we show\\nthe solid experimental performance of our method compared to several baselines,\\nincluding the PATE baseline adapted for graph-structured data. Our anonymized\\ncode is available.  \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Machine learning solutions for pattern classification problems are nowadays\\nwidely deployed in society and industry. However, the lack of transparency and\\naccountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus,\\nthere is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence\\nmechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature\\ncontributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by\\nblack-box models. An open challenge is to develop models that have intrinsic\\ninterpretability and produce their own explanations, even for classes of models\\nthat are traditionally considered black boxes like (recurrent) neural networks.\\nIn this paper, we propose a Long-Term Cognitive Network for interpretable\\npattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its own mechanism\\nfor providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each feature in the\\ndecision process. For supporting the interpretability without affecting the\\nperformance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a quasi-nonlinear\\nreasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides, we propose a\\nrecurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by unique fixed\\npoints while introducing a deterministic learning method to compute the tunable\\nparameters. The simulations show that our interpretable model obtains\\ncompetitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art white and black-box\\nmodels.  "

    "new_abstract = \"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to learn vector\\nrepresentation of graph-structured data and achieved better task performance\\nthan conventional methods. The foundation of GNNs is the message passing\\nprocedure, which propagates the information in a node to its neighbors. Since\\nthis procedure proceeds one step per layer, the range of the information\\npropagation among nodes is small in the lower layers, and it expands toward the\\nhigher layers. Therefore, a GNN model has to be deep enough to capture global\\nstructural information in a graph. On the other hand, it is known that deep GNN\\nmodels suffer from performance degradation because they lose nodes' local\\ninformation, which would be essential for good model performance, through many\\nmessage passing steps. In this study, we propose multi-level attention pooling\\n(MLAP) for graph-level classification tasks, which can adapt to both local and\\nglobal structural information in a graph. It has an attention pooling layer for\\neach message passing step and computes the final graph representation by\\nunifying the layer-wise graph representations. The MLAP architecture allows\\nmodels to utilize the structural information of graphs with multiple levels of\\nlocalities because it preserves layer-wise information before losing them due\\nto oversmoothing. Results of our experiments show that the MLAP architecture\\nimproves the graph classification performance compared to the baseline\\narchitectures. In addition, analyses on the layer-wise graph representations\\nsuggest that aggregating information from multiple levels of localities indeed\\nhas the potential to improve the discriminability of learned graph\\nrepresentations.\"\n",

    "new_abstract = 'Deep networks and decision forests (such as random forests and gradient\\nboosted trees) are the leading machine learning methods for structured and\\ntabular data, respectively. Many papers have empirically compared large numbers\\nof classifiers on one or two different domains (e.g., on 100 different tabular\\ndata settings). However, a careful conceptual and empirical comparison of these\\ntwo strategies using the most contemporary best practices has yet to be\\nperformed. Conceptually, we illustrate that both can be profitably viewed as\\n\"partition and vote\" schemes. Specifically, the representation space that they\\nboth learn is a partitioning of feature space into a union of convex polytopes.\\nFor inference, each decides on the basis of votes from the activated nodes.\\nThis formulation allows for a unified basic understanding of the relationship\\nbetween these methods. Empirically, we compare these two strategies on hundreds\\nof tabular data settings, as well as several vision and auditory settings. Our\\nfocus is on datasets with at most 10,000 samples, which represent a large\\nfraction of scientific and biomedical datasets. In general, we found forests to\\nexcel at tabular and structured data (vision and audition) with small sample\\nsizes, whereas deep nets performed better on structured data with larger sample\\nsizes. This suggests that further gains in both scenarios may be realized via\\nfurther combining aspects of forests and networks. We will continue revising\\nthis technical report in the coming months with updated results.'\n",
